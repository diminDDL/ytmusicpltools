# ytmusicpltools
A few python scripts to download liked music from ytmusic or add all liked songs to another playlist.
Each folder has all the files needed to run self-contained.
The only setup required is to set your own cookies in the [headers_auth.json](../main/ytmusic_likeToPL/headers_auth.json) file and install [ytmusicapi](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi). 
More info can be found in the official [ytmusicapi](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi) page.
